# .NET Rest Client Example Project
This project is a starting template for integrating with REST APIs on the API Platform.

It requires some simple security configuration to enable you to authenticate to the platform.

## Requirements
- .NET 9.0.x
- A client application on Morgan Stanley Azure AD tenant. Please talk to your contact at Morgan Stanley to set this up.
- A self-signed public/private key pair. Please see the client setup guide for instructions to generate this.

## Configuration
Set the following values in the ClientCredentials section in [appsettings.json](./api-template/appsettings.json).

| Property Name        | Description                                                                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ClientId`           | The client id that will be sent to you from your Morgan Stanley contact                 |
| `PrivateKeyFile`     | The path to the private_key.pem that has been created                                   |
| `PublicKeyFile`      | The path to the public_key.cer that was created and sent to your Morgan Stanley contact |
| `Scopes`             | The scope/s that will be sent to you from your Morgan Stanley contact                   |
| `Tenant`             | The tenant that will be sent to you from your Morgan Stanley contact                    |
| `Url`                | The URL of the Morgan Stanley API endpoint you are connecting to                        |

### Proxies
If you would like to route your API call through a Proxy, then add the `ProxySettings` section to [appsettings.json](./api-template/appsettings.json). For example:

```json
{
  "ClientCredentials": {
    "ClientId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    ...
  },
  "ProxySettings": {
    "ProxyHost": "proxy-host",
    "ProxyPort": "8080"
  }
}
```

### Running the Application

```shell
dotnet restore api-template
dotnet restore api-template.tests
```

Run the application:
