# Java Rest Templates

This template provides two methods for making API calls:
- Simple OkHttp request
- Retrofit2 request

For the OkHttp request, you only need to change the API endpoint that is being called. Retrofit2 requires more code changes (they are explained in the template README), but it offers a more structured and scalable approach to making API calls.
